Code examples from the paper Resting State fMRI Based Multilayer Network Configuration in Patients with Schizophrenia (pre-print: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102169).

The above was done after multilayer community detection was performed using the Mucha et al. (2010) algorithm (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1184819). For information on how to perform multilayer community detection please see http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain
